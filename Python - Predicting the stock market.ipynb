For example, train a model using data from 1951-01-03 to 2013-01-02, make predictions for 2013-01-03, and then train another model using data from 1951-01-03 to 2013-01-03, make predictions for 2013-01-04, and so on. This more closely simulates what we'd do if we were trading using the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can also improve the algorithm used significantly. Try other techniques, like a random forest, and see if they perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can also incorporate outside data, such as the weather in New York City (where most trading happens) the day before, and the amount of Twitter activity around certain stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can also make the system real-time by writing an automated script to download the latest data when the market closes, and make predictions for the next day.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, We can make the system \"higher-resolution\". You're currently making daily predictions, but you could make hourly, minute-by-minute, or second by second predictions. This will require obtaining more data, though. We could also make predictions for individual stocks instead of the S&P500."
